# TicTacTac

A simple extension of Tic Tac Toe with n x n dimension. Each player can either play X or O.
The last person played a valid move is the winner.

If n is an even number, the second player will always win. (First move in the center - Center point symmetry)
If n is an  odd number, the first  player will always win. (Center point symmetry with different symbol)
